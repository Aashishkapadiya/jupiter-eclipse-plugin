            <LI>Supports property page for each project. Now an author (team leader) of a review session is supposed to configure a review ID in the property page. You can see the property page by right clicking on a root project name in the &quot;Package Explore&quot; or &quot;Navigator&quot; view, selecting &quot;Properties | Jupiter&quot;. To create new review ID, click &quot;Add..&quot; button to start &quot;Review ID Creation&quot; wizard. You can manage review IDs there such as modification and deletion too. Along with the movement of the configuration, the review phase is only three phases (i.e. Individual Review Phase, Team Review Phase, and Rework Phase). Don't forget to commit&quot;.jupiter&quot; configuration file in the project root directory to the CVS. The former review &quot;id&quot; file was replaced by &quot;.jupiter&quot; file. Each review ID is to be stored in the &quot;.jupiter&quot; file. Note that if you are using Jupiter in a team, all team members are supposed to update this version. Otherwise, un-updated Jupiter can not recognize the previous review ID. </LI>

          <UL>
            <LI>Supports the on-select project filter when &quot;Where on-selected project is&quot; is checked in the filter preference page. This facilitates you to switch the filter domains back and forth by the selected project root icon. To use this function, you can select the &quot;Where on-selected project is&quot; is checked in the filter preference page, then select a project root icon in the &quot;Package Explore&quot;, for example. </LI>
            <LI>Supports view preference page to specify a list of columns to be included or excluded, the order of the columns, and the column width. For example, you might want to change the order of column in the individual phase. You can go to the view preference page by selecting "Window | Preferences | Jupiter | View", then select "Individual phase" from pull down menu on the top, then select summary field and click the upper arrow icon to move up by one. The order will be changed from "Icon", "Type", "Summary" to "Icon", "Summary", "Type". Don't forget to click "OK" or "Apply" to apply this change.</LI>
            <LI>Supports that the width of an column in the view is saved.</LI>
            <LI>Supports that review session is specified by review ID. The review ID defines review session. It will also define reviewers and category items such as type, severity and so forth in the future. This main advantage is to be less likely to make users conflict in CVS. <br>
              (1) Configuration- One author can define a review ID from Configuration Phase to specify Review ID and review ID file name. File name should be no space between characters .After the review ID defined the &lt;review_ID&gt;.id file will be created so that the file should be committed to the CVS. <br>
              (2) Individual Review - Reviewers update CVS to get the id file, then select the Individual Review Phase to choose one of the review ID list. They can add issues as many as possible to be stored in the review ID related review file automatically and specify Type, Severity, Summary, and Description. After reviewing it, they should commit the ID related review file to the CVS. <br>
              (3) Team Review - Moderator updates CVS to get all review files and review ID, then select the Team Review Phase to choose the review ID from the ID list. They can review as many as possible and set Resolution, Annotation, and AssignedTo field and update the modified issues. After the meeting done, one should commit all review files to CVS. <br>
              (4) Rework - The author updates CVS to get al reviewed files, then select Rework Phase to choose the review ID from the ID list. One can fix the issues and change the Status to &quot;resolved&quot; and put comments or remainder to the Rework field. After the fixes, one should commit the modified review files to the CVS. </LI>

          - New Features:
          <UL>
            <LI>Supports Eclipse 3.0 M7.</LI>
            <LI>Supports the sort by description, annotation, and revision.</LI>
            <LI>Supports the review phase partially in the both main tool bar and Jupiter view tool bar: Config, Individual, Team, and Rework phase. You can see these phase selection in the tiny down triangle button just right to the purple jupiter icon. Each phase has own columns in Jupiter Issues view. This order and column width can be configurable in the config.xml file. </LI>
            <LI>Supports XML configuration file (config.xml in the &lt;install-eclipse-dir&gt;/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/csdl.jupiter directory). This feature enables you to configure the order of each review phase and width of each column. Since &lt;ColumnHeader&gt; element will be read by the order of the description in the xml file, you can rearrange of the order. For example, if you want to assign the type followed by severity column, you can describe something like:<br>
              <PRE>&lt;ColumnHeader name=&quot;Type&quot; width=&quot;55&quot; resizable=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;ColumnHeader name=&quot;Severity&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; resizable=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</pre>
              Note that the name (as well as the name of the&lt;Configuration&gt;, and default of the &lt;View&gt;) MUST NOT be changed in this version. Otherwise it will break Jupiter. The &quot;width&quot; is the width of the column. The &quot;resizable&quot; is whether the column can be resizable or not&quot;. As you can see the first element of the &lt;ColumnHeader&gt; whose name is empty, and which is for the linked picture, its columns can not be resizable because of the &quot;resizable=false&quot;. In the future, this configuration would be made through a Jupiter preference page. </LI>
            <LI>Supports the automated incremental review on Team review phase when Enter button is pushed. This feature facilitate a moderator in a team to review each entry. For example, you can click the first issue in the top of the Jupiter review to start team review. After changing something such as resolution(e.g. from Unset to Valid-Needsfixing), you can just push &quot;Enter&quot; button to see the next listed issue in the Jupiter Issue view. </LI>

          - New Features:
          <UL>
            <LI>Supports the feature to omit the entry of "Valid-Needfixing" resolution when the "Trivial" severity is selected. It means that "Valid-Needfixing" resolution is automatically fiilled to help the quick entry in Team review mode (This might be configurable in preference page in the future). Since &quot;Trivial&quot; feature is a trivial error such as spelling miss or obvious coding standard violation, The features are filtered to be undisplayed (as if it's already reviewed as &quot;Vaild-Need fixing&quot; resolution) in order to save team review time. I hope this feature saves a time.</LI>
            <LI>Supports severity filter. This filters out the severities less priority than the selected severity in the filter preference page. For example, the minor severity is selected in the filter preference page, the trivial severity (which is less priority than minor) is filtered out so that the rest of them (minor, normal, major, and critical) are displayed in the Jupiter Issue view. </LI>
