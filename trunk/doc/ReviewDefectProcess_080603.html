<h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overview</font></h2>
<p>A traditional code review gives reviewee a chance to correct or re-design source 
  code in such a way that reviewers give comments for him/her in the text based 
  file. In the review meeting, the reviewee can check what they commented to open 
  up the text files step by step and might make sure or discuss the status of 
  each comments. This might work fairly or simply because each reviewer may only 
  create own text based file and comment the code review defects. However it sometimes 
  waste time to find even class source file for which a reviewer will comment 
  something. Or it takes a time to find the source code location the reviewer 
  pointed out in the review text file so that the members are supposed to go back 
  and forth between the review file and pointing source file.</p>
<p>A new code review approach, instead, provides reviewee and reviewer a chance 
  to take a look at their reviews more efficiently by using Eclipse Defect Code 
  Review Plugin. For reviewers' perspective, they can more easily review the reviewee's 
  source code so as: 1) to be able to find the source code location to be commented 
  quickly, 2) to be able to place a comment related to the location quickly, 3) 
  to be able to use a organized format in the review plugin interface. This gives 
  reviewers automated a review process solution. For reviewee's perspective, he/she 
  can easily take a look at their reviews so as : 1) to be able to wrap all their 
  comments to make one large list of the comments quickly, 2) to be able to jump 
  the location a reviewer pointed out quickly, 3) to be able to be for or against 
  the comments quickly, This approach saves sometime and helps both reviewers 
  and reviewee to process review more easily.</p>
<p>My current goal for code review is that by evaluating this code review plugin, 
  I will claim that the new plugin approach improves the code review process in 
  terms of perception efficiency, review (numerical) efficiency, defect (meaningful) 
  efficiency. I will define the perception efficiency as the efficiency that people 
  feel a tool is more useful in some functionalities of the review process than 
  the other tools. This efficiency would be measured by pre-questionaire and post-questionaire. 
  For example, the fact that people who have felt there is no difference between 
  any code review process in the pre-questionaire, but they come to feel that 
  the new plugin code review approach was actually useful in the post-questionaire, 
  implies that the new approach will have perception efficiency. I will define 
  the review (numerical) efficiency as the efficiency that how many defects a 
  reviewer find. This efficiency would be measured by the number of the defecst 
  found in a certain time. I will define the defect (meaningful) efficiency as 
  the efficiency that how well a reviewer finds defects. This efficiency would 
  be measured by the combination of the number of defect and the weighted defect 
  type. Since it is natural that the deferent defect type takes deferent time, 
  the harder defect to be found would be more weighted. For example, spelling 
  error or naming error defects are easy to be found so that the weighted point 
  would be 1. On the contrary, the architectural error defect are hard to be found 
  because reviewers are supposed to take a look at not only a certain class but 
  also the related classes to the class sometimes. Thurs the weighted point would 
  be 5, for example. In other words this kind of the efficiency would be measured 
  by work load, which is the number of each defect type multiplied by weighted 
  point. so that we can measure work load time (work load / time) if there is 
  a certain review time.</p>
<p>To collect the unbiased sample data from the software engineering students 
  would be hard because each person would have knowledge for the review process 
  after using either review approaches. Thus I will collect the sample data for 
  2 regular semesters, i.e. fall 2003 and spring 2003 for both 413 and 6t13 students. 
  In fall 2003, I will set 413 students to use the traditional review process 
  in the first half semester and use the plugin review process in the rest of 
  the semester while 613 students are supposed to do vice versa in the same semester. 
  In spring 2004, I will set 413 students to use the plugin review process in 
  the first half semester and use the traditional review process in the rest of 
  the semester while 613 students are supposed to do vice versa in the same semester. 
  There might exist fear that some students take both 413 and 613 classes or re-take 
  the same class within a year (fall 2003 to spring 2004). but it would not be 
  a big deal because there are few people who go to the grad school after graduation 
  of the undergraduate or there are few people who re-take the same class because 
  usually people who can not pass or drop the class from an instructor do not 
  want to take the same class or they want to take same class from the other instructor 
  if any. I should check the past data that there exist many duplicated people 
  for an instructor before analysis. I think this would not be big deal even there 
  is some duplicated people for the consecutive semesters because I may just exclude 
  the duplicated people if there are not so many. Thus the analysis of the review 
  process would be after the collection of both semesters.</p>
<p>When the review is proceeded each time, The review time period should be determined. 
  For example only reviewer should review code jut in one hour, not more and less. 
  If there is a function like button to record a time, it would help to determine 
  the time. On top of that, if there is a credit or non credit if the grace period 
  of time (plus minus 5 minutes) exist, it will force students to look at review 
  as well as the top 5 or 8 (depends upon) of the classes can get bonus credit 
  for the number of defects or working load time are found (To tell the truth, 
  I am still thinking about how I can collect the data close to the precise data).</p>
<h2>Mockup</h2>
<form name="form1" method="post" action="">
  <p>Review Mode: This makes it easier for reviewer to put comments from the source 
    code location seamlessly. All the categories such as Created by, Class, Method, 
    Line would be filled automatically by right clicking on the specific location 
    of a source code to choose a code review menu. However it would be editable 
    for the last minute changes from this interface. Status field provides the 
    current status of the comment. This status would be reflected after the change 
    in the meeting mode below so that there are post-status in the field. After 
    Post button is pushed, the new review comment would be added just below the 
    description field. Whenever added, the link to the method and line number 
    is also added so that it would help to take a look at again to modify the 
    existing comment. If the Edit button is pushed, the fields from Created by 
    through description are updated so that these information would be editable. 
    If the Remove button is pushed, the comment would be removed right away (or 
    after confirmation). Note that the unique id (for example, takuyay002) would 
    be needed for the case of the meeting mode.</p>

  <p>Meeting Mode: This makes it easier for review members to see all the comments 
    at once. All the comments could be listed by alphabetical order of the name 
    (Optionally it might be possible to order by date). The link for the method 
    and line makes it easier for them to take a look at the location a reviewer 
    commented. line number link should be exactly the same location the reviewer 
    pointed out while the method link linked to the beginning of the method. After 
    discussion, the pre-status could be changed to the proper post-status. The 
    post-status on the text would be reflected after the editor is saved (Eclipse 
    save function: Ctrl + S). Note that the text field in each comments is also 
    editable so that additional comments could be added anytime.</p>
